	`why il&fs picked this route to solvency | the smarter way to get your business news - subscribe to bloombergquint on whatsappinsolvent infrastructure finance firm il&fs ltd. has sought to reorganise its financial affairs under a scheme of arrangement involving itself and 40 group companies. the companyhas filed an application for such a scheme with the national company law tribunal, it said in a statement today.the resolution of il&fs presents a complex challenge. not only because it involves the need for additional capital as well as debt restructuring. but also because unfortunately there is no specific legal framework to work with. yet.il&fs is a core investment company as per classification of the reserve bank of india. that is, a non-banking financial company whose core business is to make investments. in rbi parlance, it is better described as a cic - si - nd or a sytemically important non-deposit accepting cic.this classification is important as it determines what route il&fs can take to resolve its insolvency.besides the complex nomenclature, that il&fs has 24 direct subsidiaries, 132 indirect subsidiaries and six joint ventures adds layers to the resolution problem.no specific insolvency framework for financial firms, yethad the financial resolution and deposit insurance bill been passed, a specific framework for resolution of financial firms would have been available.because standard insolvency processes are not suited to financial firms of systemic importance, the bill sought to create “a credible resolution regime under an expert statutory institution that is able to ensure efficient, orderly and fair resolution of financial firms,” according to the committee that worked on its draft.that expert statutory institution was conceived as a resolution corporation that would count among its members representatives of the finance ministry and key economic regulators —rbi, sebi, irdai and pfrda— along with independent members.the resolution corporation would have powers to takeover any financial firm classified as having “critical” risk of failure, administer a resolution process within two years or a liquidation process if required.this special mechanism brought to bear the force of the government and the combined expertise of regulators when resolving a financial firm of systemic importance.but the frdi bill ran into other trouble and hence, unlike several other countries, no such special route is yet available for resolution of insolvent financial firms.also read: defaulting shadow lender faces india insolvency filingcould il&fs have taken the ibc route?the insolvency and bankruptcy code, 2016 does not cover a “financial service provider”.one way into the ibc though for a company like il&fs was by special notification of the government, under section 2 of the code. this route has not been used so far, but then the ibc itself isjust under two years in implementation.even if the ibc were to apply in such a case, the layered complexity of il&fs could have made for a tough, protracted resolution, experts say.also read: rbi calls for a meeting with il&fs shareholderscompany law solutionthe companies act, 2013 does provide for a solution, even if not an ideal one.section 230 of the law provides for a scheme of compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditor or shareholders. in simple terms, a scheme to reorganise the company’s financial structure.any debt restructuring under such a scheme would need approval of at least 75 percent of the secured creditors in value. or else, such a scheme would need similar approval from shareholders. and approval from the national company law tribunal.this route bears two obvious advantages—that equity rights are maintained, important in the il&fs context as major shareholders areexpected to bring in fresh funds. in an insolvent firm equity is worth nothing.and the scheme structure offers considerable flexibility in crafting a multi-faceted solution.though as one senior corporate lawyer pointed out, on condition of anonymity, schemes have not been tested in a group insolvency situation.and the lack of certain provisions may make them unwieldy.1. for instance there is no explicit provision of a moratorium or standstill. but earlier judgments, under the 1956 act, indicate that the courts can grant moratorium, the lawyer pointed out.2. unlike ibc, there are no fixed timelines ina scheme.3. also, a resolution plan approved by the nclt under the ibc has an overriding effect over all other laws, such as income tax act. however, schemes approved by the nclt under section 230 of the companies act, 2013 do not have any such benefit. they are subject to all other applicable laws andto that extent it may reduce the effectiveness of the scheme.other difficulties may include the lack of a comprehensive framework covering all creditors, like the committee of creditors in an insolvency resolution proceeding under ibc.but given the lack of immediate other options, il&fs has picked thisroute to nurse itself back to health. details of the scheme have not been disclosed so far except that it will involve il&fs and 40 other group companies. these include il&fs transportation networks ltd., il&fs engineering & construction company ltd., il&fs energy development company ltd., il&fs maritime infrastructure company ltd., il&fs environmental infrastructure & service ltd., il&fs township & urban assets ltd., hill country properties ltd. and many of their subsidiaries.the first step towards returning to solvency has been taken.shortly before il&fs announced the filing of a scheme, bloombergquint discussed the pros and cons of ibc vs companies act with mr umarji, former legal adviser to the indian banks’ association, and bhargavi zaveri, researcher at igidr.watch that discussion here.. read more on business news by bloombergquint.`,

	`on the trail of a deadly disease that cuts down farmworkers in their prime | the smarter way to get your business news - subscribe to bloombergquint onwhatsapp(bloomberg businessweek) -- the tropical sun was beating down on homestead, a city on the southern tip of florida, when valerie mac, a nurse-scientist and occupational health specialist from emory university, pulled her van into the driveway of a small vegetable farm. its owner, isodoro gustavo, walked out to greet her, his arms caked with dirt and his face streaked with sweat and grime.mac and her two research assistants followed gustavo intohis home, where they sat him down to take his blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature and instructed him to provide a urine sample. they also drew his blood, placing the vial in a portable analysis machine. “we process it,” mac says, “pretty much like you would do in a hospital or a lab, and then we put it on dry ice right away to preserve it and get it back to the school to analyze it.”but on this particular day in august, with the mercury pushing past 90f, the machine kept overheating. the irony was not lost on mac and her crew, who were in south florida gathering data for a study about the wayextreme heat conditions affect the bodies of agricultural workers. more specifically, they’re looking for signs of stress on the kidneys, which can lead to a disease called chronic kidney disease of unknown origin, or ckdu.as its name indicates, the causes of ckdu are poorly understood. what’s not in question is that it’s deadly. symptoms—including vomiting, exhaustion, and weight loss—often don’t appear until the disease is well advanced, by which time damage to the kidneys cannot be reversed. without access to dialysis or a kidney transplant, there’s little hope of survival.ckdu first gained international recognition for its impact on sugar cane workers in nicaragua, where it’s killed at least 20,000 young men in the past decade, according to experts who describe it as an epidemic. the disease has also cropped up in other developing countries, including brazil, egypt, india, qatar, and sri lanka,predominantly among those such as field hands and construction workers who perform strenuous work outdoors. there’s no data on the number of cases worldwide.because it primarily afflicts poor people in poor countries, research around ckdu has been spotty. it’s well known that diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to chronic kidney disease, which affects 14 percent of the u.s. population. in contrast, there’s a dizzying number of hypotheses about what causes ckdu, including heat, dehydration, and exposure to pesticides or other toxins; there may also be a genetic component, according to some scientists.some hospitals in the u.s. are reporting a sharp increase in patients whose symptoms are consistent with the disease, which may lend new impetus to the search for answers.at the university of miami’s miller school of medicine, dr. alessia fornoni says the number of ckdu diagnoses has doubled sinceshe became chief of the nephrology department two years ago.“these patients show up with a picture that is very unique,” says dr. david sheikh-hamad, anephrologist affiliated with baylor st. luke’s medical center in houston. “they look very healthy, and if you didn’t check the blood, you wouldn’t haveknown that they had kidney failure.”while most experts agree that ckdu is a multifactor disease, there’s a growing consensus that sustained exposure toheat, along with dehydration, plays a leading role. this is where the emory team fits in. mac fell into ckdu research by accident after a previous study she conducted on a population of agricultural workers aged 18 to 54 in florida showed striking results: 33 percent of them experienced acute kidney injury (aki), a precursor to ckdu. the odds of a worker experiencing aki increased by almost half for each 5f increase in the heat index, a combined measure of temperature and humidity.mac’s current study, which involves about 100 people, is focused squarely on ckdu. cristina, a worker at a plant nursery near homestead, who requested that her last name be withheld, says she enrolled in the study as a way to keep tabs on her health for free. she’s acquainted with the dangers in her line of work. back in her hometown in northern mexico, her mother developed a chronic kidney condition after years of working outdoors. “i had realized that there are people in the country that are exposed to the sun,” says cristina, speaking in spanish. “there are a lot of problems that happen, and they don’t attend to them because, well, sincerely, the truth is that they don’t have the resources to get treated.”agricultural workers in this part of florida rarely have health insurance—many are undocumented immigrants from mexico and central america. (a 2018 analysis by thenonprofit national center for farmworker health determined that only 14 percent had access to employer-provided health care and just 9 percent were self-insured). as part of her study, mac helps organize training workshops for farm owners and their employees on how to guard against heat exhaustion.ruben and elude sanchez run a dragon fruit farm in redland, fla., and have a working relationship with mac and the emory study. “the biggest challenge here,as a medium-sized dragon fruit farm, is to find people who can work at the harvest time,” says ruben, speaking in spanish. “all of the farms and nurseries around here will tell you the same. hypothetically, if they were to be affected by a serious health condition, it’s going to be that much harder to get people to come to work.”mac says many producers, particularly those running larger-scale operations, don’t want their workers getting involved in studies such as hers because it can bring unwelcome scrutiny of working conditions and could stoke tensions between management and labor. “there’s mistrust on both sides,” says mac, who’s had to develop diplomatic skills in addition to her scientific training. “and for us, we’re like the third wheel.”in may, the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases hosted a conference in bethesda, md., that many described as the first concreteattempt to establish a research agenda for ckdu. mac and the team from emory were among the 120 people in attendance. “we moved it outside the sphere of kidney docs talking about a kidney problem and talked about it in terms of an environment, kidney, and gene interaction,” says susan mendley, a program director at the institute. “we’ve changed the conversation, and i think that’s a real step.”while mendley hopes the attention generated by the conference will help unlock federal funding for ckdu research, she’s not certain that will happen. “the meeting was very effective,” she says, “but now can i turn that into an initiative that lets me access the cash register? not sure yet.”climate change lends urgency to the type of research mac is doing in florida, which, of the 50 u.s. states, is expected to see by far the greatest increase in the dangerous combination of heat and humidity over the next several decades, according to a 2016 report by climate central, an independent organization that brings together scientists and journalists. miami, an hour’s drive north of homestead, is projected to log at least 100 additional “dangerous heat days,” those when the heat index tops 104f, by 2050.“we’re not as hot as central america,” says mac, sitting in a spare room at the farmworker association of florida office in homestead, which she and her crew have transformed into a makeshift lab. “but the problem is so severe in central america, why would we wait until we see that here?”to contact the editor responsible for this story: cristina lindblad at mlindblad1@bloomberg.net©2018 bloomberg l.p.. read more on business news by bloombergquint.`,
